PhishTrapis a Chrome browser extension for Twitter which detects phishing tweets in realtime. PhishTrap provides a clean, easy to use interface to display phishing tweets on your Twitter timeline. PhishTrap makes realtime decisions to save you from risky clicks on those Phish URLs. No link previews, no browser warning pages but instant, realtime indications. 

Phishtrap will show a legitimate or phish indicator (next to the URL) for tweets with URLs. Phishing URLs will have a red indicator, warning users not to click on the same and black for blacklisted urls. The legitimate links on other hand will have a green indicator.
